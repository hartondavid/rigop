RiGoPA: Risk & Governance Platform for Public Administration
üîç Project Concept:
RiGoPA is a modular software and data analytics platform designed to improve contractual risk governance, legal compliance tracking, and process performance across public institutions. Inspired by real-world ECIF operations, it supports:

Monitoring contractual workflows

Detecting risk patterns

Ensuring audit-readiness

Providing data-driven insights to legal and procurement departments

üß© Main Modules:
1. Contract Lifecycle Risk Tracker
Upload and categorize public contracts (POs, SOWs, etc.)

Flag high-risk clauses or missing compliance steps

Timeline and milestone tracking for all contract stages

2. TPH (Touch Point History) Simulator
Inspired by ECIF Operations: logs internal and external interactions (emails, updates, blockers)

Tracks the time between critical updates (e.g., SOW Pending ‚Üí PO Contracting ‚Üí PO Sent)

Flags delays or bottlenecks in legal compliance

3. Compliance & Legal Policy Engine
Compares contract terms and processes against internal/external policy rules

Integrates a versioned Regulation/Policy Library

Suggests changes for compliance based on updates (e.g., EU procurement directives)

4. Dashboard & Simulation Layer
KPI monitoring for contract throughput, delay frequency, and non-compliance risk

Simulate the impact of policy or budget changes on future contract workflows

5. Audit Trail & Documentation Generator
Automatically generates audit-compliant logs for internal and external reviews

Supports integration with digital signature platforms and PDF bundlers

üìä Data Analysis Applications:
Anomaly Detection in Contract Fulfillment Delays

Risk Score Modeling for Public Contracts (e.g., Vendor, Clause, Amount, Timeline)

Historical Patterns of Legal Escalations (like delayed SOW ‚Üí escalated PO)

Process Efficiency Analytics per Department / Project

üß± Tech Stack (Suggested):
Backend: Python (FastAPI or Django), PostgreSQL

Data Analysis: Pandas, Scikit-learn (risk modeling), NetworkX (dependency graphs)

Frontend: React.js or Streamlit (for internal prototyping)

Automation: Power Automate / Zapier integration for email + approval monitoring

Optional ML Module: Use historical contract + process data to train models for risk prediction or approval delay forecasts

üéØ Strategic Long-Term Goals:
Offer it as a GovTech SaaS for institutions across Eastern Europe (e.g., Moldova, Romania, Western Balkans)

Open-source the base version for academic and transparency-related institutions

Build partnerships with audit courts, anti-corruption NGOs, and compliance units
